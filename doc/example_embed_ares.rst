Embedding *ares* in your own code
=================================
If you want to summon *ares* to generate models within a larger calculation (say, a model grid, MCMC fit, etc.) but for whatever reason do NOT want to use the built-in machinery for such things (no hard feelings!), the procedure should be fairly painless. You can basically follow the same approach as has been outlined in other areas of the documentation:

    * :doc:`example_gs_standard`
    * :doc:`example_litdata` (see bottom for common models)
